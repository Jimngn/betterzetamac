# Zetamac Arithmetic Game Clone

A faithful recreation of the popular Zetamac arithmetic speed drill with enhanced times table practice features.

## Features

### Original Zetamac Features
- **Addition**: Customizable number ranges for both operands
- **Subtraction**: Addition problems in reverse
- **Multiplication**: Customizable number ranges for both operands  
- **Division**: Multiplication problems in reverse
- **Duration Options**: 30, 60, 120, 300, or 600 seconds
- **Score Tracking**: Count correct answers within time limit
- **Must Answer Correctly**: No skipping - you must get each problem right to advance

### Enhanced Times Table Practice
Perfect for mastering individual times tables with comprehensive practice options:

- **Specific Number Focus**: Choose any times table from 1-12
- **Bidirectional Practice**: 
  - Forward: 3 × 1, 3 × 2, 3 × 3, etc.
  - Reverse: 1 × 3, 2 × 3, 3 × 3, etc.  
  - Combined: Both directions mixed together
- **Division Practice**: Include division problems (e.g., 12 ÷ 3, 15 ÷ 3)
- **Customizable Range**: Practice up to 1-20 if desired (default 1-12)

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Choose your operations and settings on the main page
2. **Times Table Mode**: Check "Practice specific times table" for focused practice
   - Select which times table to focus on (1-12)
   - Choose directions: forward, reverse, or both
   - Optionally include division problems
3. **Start**: Click "Start" to begin the timed drill
4. **Play**: Answer problems correctly to advance (incorrect answers don't advance)
5. **Results**: See your final score when time runs out

## Example Times Table Practice

If you select the "3" times table with both forward and reverse enabled:
- Forward problems: 3 × 1, 3 × 2, 3 × 7, etc.
- Reverse problems: 1 × 3, 8 × 3, 12 × 3, etc.
- Mixed randomly during the game

This solves the original Zetamac limitation where practicing a specific times table (like 3×) would either only give you 3×1-12 OR would expand to full 1-12×1-12 range.
