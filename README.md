# Zetamac Arithmetic Game Clone

A recreation of the popular Zetamac arithmetic speed drill with times table practice features cause I suck at it.

Everything's the same as zetamac just with the times table

### Times Table Practice

- **Specific Number Focus**: Choose any times table from 1-12
- **Bidirectional Practice**: 
  - Forward: 3 × 1, 3 × 2, 3 × 3, etc.
  - Reverse: 1 × 3, 2 × 3, 3 × 3, etc.  
  - Combined: Both directions mixed together
- **Division Practice**: Include division problems (e.g., 12 ÷ 3, 15 ÷ 3)
- **Customizable Range**: Practice up to 1-20 if desired (default 1-12)



## Example Times Table Practice

If you select the "3" times table with both forward and reverse enabled:
- Forward problems: 3 × 1, 3 × 2, 3 × 7, etc.
- Reverse problems: 1 × 3, 8 × 3, 12 × 3, etc.
- Mixed randomly during the game

This solves the original Zetamac limitation where practicing a specific times table (like 3×) would either only give you 3×1-12 OR would expand to full 1-12×1-12 range.
